Wondrous dharmakāya Amitābha—'Limitless Light',

Avalokiteśvara and Vajrapāṇi-Mahāsthāmaprāpta,

I pray to you with single-pointed intention:
milam yul gyi dechen shying drö né
Inspire me with your blessings, so that I may travel in my dreams
nangwa tayé jalwar jingyi lob
To the Land of Great Bliss and there encounter Amitābha.
