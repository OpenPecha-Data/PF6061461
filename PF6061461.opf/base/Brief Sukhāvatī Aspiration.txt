Brief Sukhāvatī Aspiration
from the terma of Mingyur Dorje

emaho, ngotsar sangye nangwa tayé dang
Emaho!  Amitābha, magnificent Buddha of Boundless Light,
yé su jowo tukjé chenpo dang
With the great compassionate lord Avalokiteśvara to his right,
yöndu sempa tuchen tob nam la
And Vajrapāṇi-Mahāsthāmaprāpta on his left,
sangye changsem pakmé khor gyi kor
Surrounded by an assembly of countless buddhas and bodhisattvas
dekyi ngotsar paktu mepa yi
In the place of wonder and boundless joy and happiness
dewachen shyejawé shyingkham der
That is the heavenly realm of Sukhāvatī, the Blissful Paradise.
dak ni di né tsé pö gyur ma tak
When the time comes for me to leave this present life,
kyewa shyen gyi bar ma chöpa ru
May I go there directly, without any other birth upon the way,
dé ru kyé né nang té shyal tong shok
And being reborn there, may I see Amitābha face to face!
deké dak gi mönlam tabpa di
May this, my fervent prayer of aspiration,
chok chü sangye changsem tamché kyi
Be blessed by all the buddhas and bodhisattvas of the ten directions
gekmé drubpar jingyi lab tu sol
So that it is accomplished, without the slightest hindrance!

When Tulku Mingyur Dorje was thirteen years old, on the 7th day of the month of Saga Dawa, Fire
Bird year (1657), he had a vision of the deities of the maṇḍala, and Buddha Amitābha spoke
these words directly.
